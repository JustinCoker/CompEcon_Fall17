Capital Accumulation by Firm

objective: max discounted PV of profits

max_{k_{t+1}, I_t, l_t|_0^\infty} sum_{0^\infty} Mult_{0^t} (\frac{1}{1+r_t})[\pi(z_t, k_t, l_t) - p_t^k * I_t]

where p_t^k is price of capital goods, I_t is gross investment

z_t is productivity, K_t is capital, l_t is labor, \pi is profit fn

discounting by r_t

I_t = k_{t+1}-(1-\delta)k_t

\delta= rate of depreciation

Law of motion for captial

k_{t+1} = (1-\delta)k_t + I_t

so choice of K_{t+1} pins down I_t and reverse

key note: k_{t+1} is chosen at time t, but productive at t+1

\pi() = R(z,k,l) - wl

R() = p*q(z,k,l) or q(z,k,l) if normalize price to 1

q() = zk^{\alpha_k}l^{\alpha_l}

l_t does not depend on l_{t-1}, but is chosen independently each period; not an intertemperal choice.

t,f, we can write \pi(z,k) = max_l \pi(z,k,l)
i.e. profit is a function of z, k when l is chosen optimally given known value of z_t, k_t since k_t is known at period t, was chosen at t-1.

policy function:
l(z, k) = argmax_l \pi(z, k, l)
