A major threat to identification is the fact that we cannot be sure that teachers observe a student's previous test performance.
However, the teacher's expected score is recorded at the end of the school year (around the time the test is administered).
Therefore, a teacher may not directly internalize the ``shock" created by a lower achievement level. It could be argued, however,
that if the student internalizes this shock and this changes their behavior throughout the school year, it may be reconciled
into the teacher's expectations.

An additional threat to identification is that the shock may be internalized by students and not teachers. In this case, the affect
we will record is the fall (or rise) in performance with expectations held constant. Since we cannot distinguish between
the performance affect and the expectation effect, we are unable to be sure which effect is being observed.
